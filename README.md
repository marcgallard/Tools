## Structure Format

I've tried to organize the repo according to the nature of the tools and the problem they attempt to address. For example, the very first tool I'm creating is for encoding images to Base64; the utility for this tool is to bake images into notes using note-taking software that supports rendering Base64 strings. Its structure would look something like 'Data Manipulation > Base64 > Base64Encode.py'.

The typical structure I'll follow is '\[Topic\] > \[Sub-topic or concept\] > \[script\]'. This may change in the future if the tool becomes sophisticated enough in that it requires several other scripts. The root level's table of contents tries to encapsulate the general themes of my scripts, with each sub-level giving more specific explanations until the user reaches the script itself. This is done for organizational purposes (at least until I figure out a better system to use).

## Current Structure

1. Data Manipulation - Anything involving manipulation of data

## Prerequisites

Unless noted otherwise, I am using Python3, specifically 3.10 at the time of this writing (4/21/22). I tend to install packages using pip.
